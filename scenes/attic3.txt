ATTIC3

Why is the house showing this to you? Does it think it can trick you into staying with this poor soul? You know deep in your heart that this isnâ€™t real so with a heavy heart you keep marching. Their mournful wails pierce your heart even as distance muffles them. Even after the snowy path disappeared, your feet once again stepping on hard wooden stairs, the wails and the heaviness of your heart stay with you. The staircase seems no closer to ending but you march on.
