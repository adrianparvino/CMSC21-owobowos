BASEMENT POST BOX

To your surprise, the small dingy room showed great restraint by staying the same. No odd flashes of colors between
ephemeral cracks in reality, no patches disappearing and reappearing into and from the ether, no sudden and brief
transformations into totally different locations. The damp dark room is still lit by the two torches flanking the
entryway shrouded in darkness. The boxes are still as you left them, ransacked with their flaps still open. The
room's stability unnerves you. You are constantly waiting for the shoe to drop.
