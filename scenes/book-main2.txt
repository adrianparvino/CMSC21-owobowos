BOOK MAIN2

You keep reading even if there's a migraine building. The margin notes begin to eclipse the actual contents of the book. It reads as frustrated at both the author of the book and at its own author. You continue to read and the book seemingly merges into an entirely different one. The printed text on cream paper turns into handwritten notes on lined paper before your very eyes. You flip to the prior pages and find that the academic text has completely disappeared. You are now holding a journal. 

You skim through the author's entries and it speaks of a tired student frustrated at how difficult the material iwas and how they stumbled on the work of a wisdomseeker - likely the author of the original book - that speaks of a ritual to summon an entity that would do whatever you asked it to. The findings were significant enough to get the wisdomseeker support from a large company, though the company was never named.
