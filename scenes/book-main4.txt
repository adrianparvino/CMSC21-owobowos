BOOK MAIN4

Equally enthused, you turn the page eagerly only to find the next page torn. The page that follows is a curious one, to put it lightly. It reads,

"This was truly a wonderful idea.
Was not this fun?
A truly fruitful endeavor.
Mistake, I would never call this that."

It's entirely different from the author's usual style, often dry and negative. Curiouser, there are tear stains dotting the page. Not only that, the handwriting is incredibly messy, almost as if the author was in duress. You bring the book closer to inspect it further but find something more exciting. 

There are indents of the missing page imprinted onto the page you're examining. If only there was something you could use to fill it out.

Perhaps you could find one laying around?
