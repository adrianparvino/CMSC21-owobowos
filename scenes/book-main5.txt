BOOK MAIN5

Oh wait. You do have something - a pencil! You eagerly take it out of your pocket and gently fill the entire page
with graphite. It is a bit harder to read due to the pre-existing words but it helps that the grooves are deep. The
message you uncover is "IT'S IN THE BASEMENT".

You put down the book in excitement. A clue! But as your eyes adjust to the scenario you startle. Without realizing
it, the world has changed around you.
