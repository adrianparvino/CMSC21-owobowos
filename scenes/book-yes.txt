BOOK YES

Your brain goes into overdrive, almost as if to spite your internal subconscious. It flies through the text and
what it surmises are as follows:

The powerful being is known to be a benevolent figure of legend, capable of being whoever it needed to be to serve
the summoner the best. The owner of the house was definitely the author of this book and the failed attempt to
summon the being was what caused the house to go crazy - the misplaced magic going haywire. The key to the entrance
is in the basement.

You put down the book satisfied but then startle. Without realizing it, the world has changed around you.
