BOXES

When you open the first box, you are greeted with stacks of academic papers. In the second box, you find tense
correspondence between two individuals battling out for what you guess are the rights to sell something. Under
the final box whose contents are too water damaged to understand, you find a torn piece of paper. From what you
can gather, it says:

	"roads that -
	may just le-
third times-"

You pocket the note and return to the mouth of the entryway.
