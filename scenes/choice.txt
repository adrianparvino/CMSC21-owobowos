CHOICE

Fine. You win! Congratulations you outsmarted the magical fae supposedly more intelligent than you humanoids could
ever hope to be. I snap my fingers and a door appears. It looks exactly like the door in the foyer.

I offer out my hand. You look at me confused and I point out your pocket stuffed with miscellaneous things. You're
beginning again aren't you? No need to have all this stuff weighing you down. Instead, have this. I conjure up a
plain necklace and offer it to you.

[CHOICES]
- [ACCEPT] Accept the necklace.
- [DECLINE] Decline the necklace.
