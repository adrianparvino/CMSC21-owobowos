COFFEE TABLE MAIN2

Ah. You’ve gotten distracted again. Enough stalling. It's time to see if your hand has remembered what your mind has forgotten. Your hand finally puts pencil onto paper after what feels like a millennia and starts drawing.

The end result is utterly terrible. You intended to draw a quick portrait of a standard elf - pointy ears, long flowing hair, perfect smile - but what is on paper would likely cause insult to any elf unfortunate enough to lay their eyes upon it. To put it simply, it is ugly but surprisingly this brings you no shame. The red hot embarrassment that had been soiling your stomach has evaporated into nothingness. You’re too busy reveling in the joy of partaking in a hobby you haven't done in so long that it all seems inconsequential. Who cares if it looks terrible, you had fun drawing it.

You decide to keep both the pencil and the sketchbook. Maybe you’ll get another chance to draw sometime soon.
