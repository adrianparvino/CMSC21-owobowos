COFFEE TABLE WRONG NO

The burning embarrassment is too strong to ignore. You have forgotten what a pencil is for Maker's sake, the
memory of how to hold one has escaped your muscles in spite of the years of searing it into them through daily
use. To draw was always a challenge but it was like coming home. The thought of losing the safety of another home
so soon is too much. You pocket it.

Huh. Curious.

Your hand brushes against something already in your pocket when you put the pencil away. You don't remember putting
anything else there so your hand takes it on its way out. Pinched between your fingers is a scrap of paper that
reads "Don't forget the books!". The handwriting is oddly familiar. You hate that you can't confidently determine
whether or not it's yours. You pocket it again. It was on your person so even if you can't remember, surely it
was important enough to keep on you.
Don't forget the books!, you think to yourself. Well - your mind wanders to the pencil in your pocket - you'll
try to, but you can't make any promises.
