DOOR+KEYCARD4

The door opens to another different door. It is a simple door, though not as plain as the prior doors. The combination "G-3" is carved into the wood at around eye level. There is a combination lock in place of a keyhole. Patches of blue flowers - forget-me-nots, your mind finally remembers -  decorate the feet of the door. 

What do you put into the combination lock?
