FOYER NTH

You have once again stepped into the foyer. The chandelier is still on the ceiling, although it seems to occasionally
forget what design it used to have, morphing into something new every time you take your eyes off it. The table
is still there though overrun by the plants flanking it. The bannisters of the stairs have become impossible to
tell apart from all the foliage. Thankfully the steps have been spared. The twin doors to the outside world stand
strong though the glass adorning it has gone dark, impossible to see through. The locked door is the only thing
that remains entirely unchanged.

Many areas of the room flicker in and out of view. Sometimes, the parts that return from whatever void they
disappear to are entirely different to what left.
