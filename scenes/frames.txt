FRAMES

A portrait of a pretty elf woman catches your eye. Green eyes, brown hair, and a gentle smile. She appears to be in archaic robes with a brilliant ball of magic dancing on her outstretched hand. The placard says "Lady Felicia - Wisdomseeker". The big fleur pinned to her robes point to her being the owner of this charming house.
