INTERSECTION1

You walk in total darkness for what seems like an eternity until a red glow fills the room. What greets you straight ahead appears to be a gaping angry maw, glowing red with rage. The growls you hear from beyond imprint deep into your bones a primal fear that wants you to run. To your left there is another entryway. There is nothing particularly special about it. 

Which direction will you choose?
