INTERSECTION2

Your first few steps are unsteady, wary of any particularly nasty surprises this maze might cook up. They grow more confident as nothing emerges from the shadows to eat you but they never completely lose the wariness. As you continue walking, the dark stone melts into brick as the area around you becomes a stereotypical sunny day. You look around in confusion when suddenly a hand grasps your own.

You scream in terror but it's only a beautiful human. Her appearance pangs at you for reasons your terrified mind cannot recall. The human does not seem to have noticed your scream and asks, "Which place do you want to go to?"

It is only through her prompting that you realize that both of you are at a crossroads. Up ahead there is a beautiful brick building, complete with clusters of blue flowers decorating the planter boxes decorating its facade. To your right there is a park which has an arch for an entryway. Several plants crawl up the arch, their leaves covering up the metal. Bushes of white flowers surround the entire park.
	
The human looks at you expectantly. Where do you want to go?
