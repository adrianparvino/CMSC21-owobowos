INTERSECTION3.2+TORN

Your eyes widen in realization. It’s the other half of the torn paper from earlier! You quickly free one hand to grab the note from earlier to combine the two. Together the note says: “roads that lead to nowhere may just lead to the end. third times the charm”

You keep the paper and further examine what you have unearthed. It's a thin rectangular card of sorts. There are things written on it but they have long since faded. All that remains is a blurry square photo of a gentle looking elf. Pocketing your findings you continue on. 

It shouldn’t have surprised you when the dark walkway transformed into a room filled to the brim with books - a library, you guess. In your feeble defence, unlike the prior transformation, this was more abrupt. One step, it was the dingy maze. A step after that it was a library. You will say, when the stern looking centaur appeared in front of you, you valiantly resisted the urge to scream like last time. The old centaur looks at you expectantly and says, “Have you decided if you wish to continue or not?”

He points at the majestic double door that you somehow instinctively know leads back to the main campus. The way he automatically assumes the answer is yes grates on your nerves. Your eyes catch the exit sign to your left. The exit has never been more appealing.

The centaur taps his hooves impatiently. What door do you choose?

[CHOICES]
- [DOUBLE] The huge double door that leads to the main campus
