INTRODUCTION6

Your kitchen, the kitchen you realize you were never actually in, is beginning to fall apart. Patches of it fade
into the ether and are replaced with parts of a kitchen that is both foreign and all too familiar to you. Tiled
countertops fade into mahogany ones. Plastic cabinets into polished wood ones. You are not home, you haven't been
for a very very long time.

[COUNTER]

Days, years, attempts of escape? You don't know, you don't remember. It doesn't matter, you just need to get out.

The windows remain befuddled in their presentation, the outside world split into mixed matched fragments. The
kitchen is ever shifting, almost confused in what it wants to be. The only constant is a door in the corner of
the room. It calls you.
