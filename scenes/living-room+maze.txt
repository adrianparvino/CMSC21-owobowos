LIVING ROOM+MAZE

You find yourself in the living room. The walls still decorated by framed portraits of people and places, the shelves still lined with haphazardly stacked newspapers, the coffee tableâ€™s top still messy with knicknacks. The entryway and oddly plain door are where you left them but the same cannot be said for the rest of the room. More and more patches have been overtaken by snippets of scenes beyond this house.

Interestingly enough, the curtains of each window have been pulled back. They all show a bright and sunny day - the same bright and sunny day.
