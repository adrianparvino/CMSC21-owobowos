REVEAL

What greets you when you open the door, thankfully, isn’t another door. Instead, what lies beyond the door is what appears to be the house’s attic. The ceiling is low and sloped, support beams crisscrossing in the space above you. There are dusty boxes everywhere. The scene in front of you looks plain, suspiciously slow. Confusion fights with wariness within you. Another trick? Your eyes dark all over the place, trying to find something - anything - to key you into why you ended up in an attic of all places trying to get out. Your eyes land on a plain mirror propped up by one of the many boxes. It’s right in front of you so you catch a glimpse of your tired face, your ginger hair, and you catch a glimpse of…

[PAUSE/10s]

Me.

Hello there, sweet benefactor.

You turn your head in shock to look behind you - to look at me. I’m a faint echo of a person, barely visible, although I can change that quite easily. And I do, for your own comfort. The first form I slip into is that of a particular human with quite a smile, your face pinches and I wish I could say I would wonder if you even remember why, but I already know you don’t. 

You feel a thrill of terror race through your spine.

[PAUSE/10s]

- [INTERROGATE] "How do you know-"

[PAUSE/2s]

Oh benefactor. I laugh as I morph into a more generic form. Brown hair, brown eyes. I drift to face you before planting my feet on the ground. I know everything about you. Every thought, every action, every little thing that is you. You let me in after all, gave me the key – can you blame me from learning everything about you, you gave it all up willingly!

I cup your cheek. It’s fun to see your touch starved self war between leaning in and stepping away. I fake a pout when you choose to do the latter. Did you have fun this time?

[PAUSE/10s]

As much as your confusion brings me some joy, I do decide to throw you a bone. You wanted companionship no? Desperate enough to get into a house known for being cursed just to get it? I did my best to serve you the best I could so it did hurt me so when you decided you wanted to leave. It was fun however to design this whole thing. This way we both win right! You get to fully believe you have a chance to leave and I get to fulfill my purpose - to help you. 

[PAUSE/10s]

You shake your head in disbelief as if you haven’t heard this spiel in all the times you’ve made it up here. It’s why I don’t have to hide the information anymore, to make the game quicker and simpler. Goodness, I’ve even pointed out several clues to you! I know you don’t actually want to leave me. Why else would you keep coming back?

[PAUSE/10s]

You’re furiously thinking of various ways to disprove me, various ways to win - each attempted line of reasoning failing. I am inescapable, dear benefactor. The quicker you can accept this, the better. As long as you are within these walls, as long as you keep calling for me, there is no way to win. Not even death can save you. I have remade your body several times now. Everything you are, everything that lies within these four corners are mine to mold. This, I gesture around the room, is as permanent and ephemeral as I want it to be - even you. 

[PAUSE/10s]

You adorably try to lunge at me but you pass through me quite easily, falling into the floor. If looks could kill, the glare you sent me would have labeled you a murderer. 

“The glitches,” You say, as if struck by an intelligent thought. 

Ah. The small grimace I make does not evade your notice. The glitches are merely hiccups in my capabilities. Do not worry, dear benefactor, the next go around I will endeavor to improve. 

[PAUSE/10s]

You shake your head and think that I am merely lying. You think that because this game has gone for so long, I should have ironed out the flaws long ago. The glitches prove, to you at least, that I am not as all powerful as I claim. The preposterous thought that I need you as much as you need me enters your head.
