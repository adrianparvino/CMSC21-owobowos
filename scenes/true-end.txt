TRUE END

I do not know where you go when you leave our beloved home. It is unfortunately out of my reach. You may not believe me but I do wish you the best. The world out there is cruel, confusing, messy. It is not like the home we have built together. I am not there to make it easier for you. Your daunting challenges, your difficult tasks, the burden to accomplish them rests on your shoulders. Your mistakes are your own but so are your successes. Perhaps that makes it sweeter. Perhaps that's what it means to be â€¦ you.  

Farewell, dear benefactor. Remember that if it ever gets too hard, you can always come back to me, back to the house where nothing matters but the end and the beginning, again, and again, and again.
