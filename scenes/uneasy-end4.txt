UNEASY END4

When you hear the shrill beeps of your crystal’s alarm, you want nothing more than to ignore it and return to your pillow's sweet embrace. Unfortunately, you have work to be done. You drag yourself out of your comfortable bed with great effort. While carefully combing your nest of hair into submission, your mind wanders to the wonderful dream you had. You can only remember bits and pieces, consciousness stealing away the memories your subconscious dreamt of, but you faintly recall running through an idyllic field and exploring an equally idyllic forest. It’s all quickly fading away as the time for dreams has passed. You are in the waking world now. 

It’s the beginning of a brand new day. Time to go seize it.
